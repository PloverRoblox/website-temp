                <h2>Discord Server Guidelines</h2>
                <h3><em>Guidelines for Plover and Plover Legal.</em></h3>
                <p><strong>Do not organize, participate in, or encourage harassment of
                    others.</strong> Disagreements happen and are normal, but continuous,
                    repetitive, or severe negative comments may cross the line into
                    harassment and are not okay.</p>
                <p><strong>Do not talk badly about others in chatrooms.</strong> It’s unacceptable to
                    attack a person or a community based on attributes such as their
                    race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation,
                    religious affiliation, or disabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Do not make threats of violence or threaten to harm others.</strong> This
                    includes indirect threats, as well as sharing or threatening to share
                    someone’s private personal information (also known as doxxing).</p>
                <p><strong>Do not evade user blocks or server bans.</strong> Do not send unwanted,
                    repeated friend requests or messages, especially after they’ve
                    made it clear they don’t want to talk to you anymore. Do not try to
                    hide your identity in an attempt to contact someone who has
                    blocked you, or otherwise circumvent the tools we have which
                    enable users to protect themselves.</p>
                <p><strong>Do not send others viruses or malware, </strong>attempt to phish others,
                    hack them or DDoS them.</p>
                <p><strong>You may not sexualize minors in any way.</strong> This includes sharing
                    content or links which depict minors in a pornographic, sexually
                    suggestive, or violent manner, and includes illustrated or digitally
                    altered pornography that depicts minors (such as lolicon, shotacon,
                    or cub). We report illegal content to Discord.</p>
                <p><strong>You may not share sexually explicit content of other people
                    without their consent, </strong>or share or promote sharing of non-
                    consensual intimate imagery (also known as revenge porn) in an
                    attempt to shame or degrade someone.</p>
                <p><strong>You may not share content that glorifies or promotes suicide or
                    self-harm, </strong>including any encouragement to others to cut
                    themselves, or embrace eating disorders such as anorexia or
                    bulimia.</p>
                <p><strong>You may not share images of sadistic gore or animal cruelty.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Do not mess up counting in #counting on purpose. This could
                    include messing up with random numbers multiple times.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Do not Advertise in the Discord server.</strong> This includes advertising
                    in DMs and tickets. Advertising in the Marketplace category is
                    allowed as long as the specific rules for it are followed.</p>
                <p><strong>Do not spam ping roles/users.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Do not ask for free tech or advertise yourself giving away
                    free tech.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Do not try to bypass our filters with slurs like the N**ger,
                    Tra*ny, and Fag*ot.</strong> Any term that may be considered
                    derogatory to another group is also not allowed.</p>
                <p><strong>Do not misuse Plover marketplace and follow all rules in it.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>If you are a buyer, you must follow the buyer agreement.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Do not leak Plover assets.</strong> This includes leaking in direct
                    messages, server chat channels, tickets, and subsidiary servers.
                    This also includes files and links that contain Plover assets.</p>
                <p><strong>Do not join the Plover Discord if you are under 13 years old.</strong> Staff members may challenge you to verify your identity via
                    student identification card without your last name, school, and
                    other identifiable information present if reported.</p>
                <p><strong>Follow the Discord and Roblox community guidelines.</strong> Any
                    violations will get you banned and will be reported to both
                    companies.</p>
                <p><strong>Do not spread leaked games or assets in Plover chatrooms
                    or in Direct Messages with other users.</strong> This can be from any
                    group on Roblox. Plover understands how hard it is to have
                    assets leaked and wants to help combat that.</p>
                <p><strong>Alternative Accounts will be banned.</strong> Alternative accounts can
                    become a security threat and can be considered ban evasion. When
                    searching for alternative accounts (alts) we look for inactivity, not
                    being verified with Bloxlink, not accepting server agreements, Nitro
                    and Hypesquad status, Roblox account data, account creation date,
                    chat history in other Discord servers and with users we ask.</p>
