                <h2>Getting a License</h2>
                <p>When getting a license, the group owner should be the one
                    holding it. Developers cannot use their own licenses individually
                    and must transfer ownership to the group owner. If we find that
                    groups are not following this policy, Plover reserves the right to
                    blacklist you and the institution you represent from registering
                    new licenses, joining the Discord, and joining our group. We can
                    also file a DMCA takedown in some cases.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Hiring Devs and Game Access</h2>
                <p>When buying a license, Plover contributors will ask for a list of
                    people with access to your place. We require that you consult
                    Plover when hiring more developers. This process helps us keep
                    track of who is in contact with Plover technology. It can also be a
                    great way to background check developers. Failure to follow this
                    rule gives Plover the right to blacklist you and the institution you
                    represent from registering new licenses, joining the Discord, and
                    joining our group. We can also file a DMCA claim in some cases.</p>

                <h2>Leaking via Place Stealing or
                    Untrusted Developer</h2>
                <p>If a game you own has been leaked, we require you start a ticket
                    in Plover immediately. List all items that were leaked and send a
                    link to the leaked place. Plover staff will handle DMCA claiming,
                    which will grant us the opportunity to revoke any tech products.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Leaking via The Buyer</h2>
                <p>If a buyer is found leaking a game with Plover tech, or the actual
                    models, the buyer will be blacklisted from Plover with no appeal.
                    All assets they own will be revoked and they will be banned from
                    all Plover Discord Servers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Asking for Models</h2>
                <p>If you are found asking for free Plover assets, Plover staff have
                    the right to blacklist you and the institution you represent from
                    registering new licenses, joining the Discord, and joining our
                    group.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>What it Means For The Buyer
                    When Plover Tech is Leaked</h2>
                <p>Buyers of certain Plover products will be notified via
                    announcement. The model that has been leaked will have its
                    mesh revoked and buyers will be forced to replace them. Buyers
                    will be given a replacement model in place of the leaked model,
                    free of charge. This ensures that Plover can maintain low prices
                    and prevent sale shutdowns.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Recoloring and Rebranding</h2>
                <p>Recoloring of Plover tech is allowed if logos and branding stay
                    visible. For example if you make a bed Black, you should make
                    the Plover logo white. There must be a minimum contrast ratio
                    of 4.5:1 between the background and the logo.
                    Rebranding Plover tech is a huge violation and can lead to a
                    blacklist and a DMCA takedown.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Reselling and Trading</h2>
                <p>Reselling Plover tech is prohibited. Redistribution of tech
                    licenses is also prohibited, buyers found reselling or trading
                    Plover tech will be blacklisted immediately with no appeal.
                    Plover will also file a DMCA claim against the buyers game and
                    group.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Selling Pre-Built Hospitals</h2>
                <p>Buyers are not allowed to purchase Plover licenses for the sole
                    purpose of tech being placed into hospital games for sale. When
                    selling buildings you have created, you are required to remove all
                    Plover tech from them. Selling pre-built hospitals containing
                    Plover Tech is equal to independently reselling it. This can lead
                    to the same punishments found in the Reselling and Trading
                    section.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Selling Groups with Plover
                    Technology in their Games</h2>
                <p>Selling groups is against the Roblox Terms of Service. Plover
                    dislikes entities or individuals who mass purchase hospitals form
                    associations. When selling your group, please inform the buyer
                    that they must also pay for the Plover licensing. Moreover, this
                    also means that the buyer is not blacklisted from Plover. If the
                    seller sees fit, they may also transfer over all their licenses to the
                    buyer by opening a ticket in our main Discord. However, all
                    group selling license transfer are final and will not be reversed.
                    Plover will not assist with scamming in these cases.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Investigation Notice</h2>
                <p>When you use the tech you got from an ingenuine source, or you
                    are reported for having leaked tech, you give Plover the right to
                    deploy contributors to take note of every item in your campus
                    and report back to Plover. You are required to have the buyer
                    certification notice you received during your purchase of the
                    equipment in your hospital lobby or visible behind a reception
                    desk If you do not, Plover will assume the medical equipment
                    you have is leaked and launch an investigation.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Punishments</h2>
                <p>Plover reserves the right to do the following if you do not follow
                    the rules in this agreement.</p>
