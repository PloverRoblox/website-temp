                <h2>What Constitutes a Mute</h2>
                <p>Muting is when a user loses access to every channel in Plover
                    except #ban-lands. Mutes are also referred to as shadow-bans.
                    Muting is the lowest punishment and can be assigned by anyone
                    with Moderator perms. <br><br>
                    Mutes can be given when:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A user messed up counting in #counting on purpose. (3h)</li>
                    <li>A user needs a timeout during a conversation in a general
                        chat (2d) <ul><li><em>A timeout is needed when a user is using slurs to make
                            people mad, getting heated over politics and, treating
                            people or whole groups. Look for overall aggravation.</em></li></ul></li>
                    <li>A user is DM Advertising (10d)</li>
                    <li>A user is leaking Plover assets and we need to investigate
                        (3y)</li>
                    <li>A user is spam pinging (1d)</li>
                    <li>A user is breaking rules but does not qualify for a ban or kick
                        (30d)</li>
                    <li>A user is talking about leaked Plover tech they have or
                        asking people for free tech (3d)</li>
                    <li>A user is using filter bypass to say slurs (N**ger, Tra*ny, and
                        Fag*ot.) (2d)</li>
                    <li>A user is talking badly about another person (5h)</li>
                    <li>A user is misusing Plover Marketplace (1d)</li>
                </ol>
                <p><em>The (#d) after is the max amount of time the punishment can last!<br>
                    Example: 1d = 1 day. 5h = 5 hours.<br>
                    When a user is muted they should also be warned!</em></p>

                <h2>What Constitutes a Warning</h2>
                <p>Warning a user adds a warning to their account. Once a user
                    had 6 warning they will be temp banned from Plover for 3 days.
                    Warns should be used as a way to let people know they are
                    doing something wrong and should stop. <br><br>
                    Warns can be given when:</p>

                    <li>When a user spams messages to win a giveaway.</li>
                    <li>Inappropriate emoji reactions such as NSFW emojis showing
                        gore and sexual content in the News and Miscellaneous
